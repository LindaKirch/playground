so i was working on a statistics textbook layout recently and thought itd b fun2 try apply 1 of the chapter exercises in probability to #6 as a function problem... like how to figure out the probability of pulling a blackjack from a fair deck of cards. can a js function solve this?



, maybe limit the parameters to return the number of possible combinations of cards, for 3 random picks: "Card1pick, Card2pick, Card3pick..."? 

take a look at Math.random, that might help you out
